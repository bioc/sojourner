\usage{
plotIndividualMSD(trackll=trackll,dt=6,lag=c(2:5),resolution=0.107,t.interval=0.01,sort="Rsquare",plot.fit=TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{trackll}{trajectory list generated by createTrackll() and processing.}

\item{dt}{max time interval, default is 6.}

\item{lag}{time intervals for linear regression to calculate diffusion coefficient, default is 2 to 5.}

\item{resolution}{ratio of pixel to ÂµM.}

\item{t.interval}{Time interval for image aquisition. Default 0.5 sec (500ms).}

\item{sort}{trajectories will be sorted by given parameters, "RT" for dwell time, "Dcoef" for diffusion coefficient, "Rsqare" for R squared of Mean squared Displacement (MSD) fitting.}

\description{
Plot the correlation between diffusion coefficient and Rsquare of the MSD fit in a trackll. 
With an option to plot individual MSD and linear regression of all tracks one by one, with grid layout.
             Tracks can be sorted by their lengths, diffusion coefficient or R square of the MSD linear regresson.
}
\details{
Plot individual track/trajectory one by one, and the tracks will be layout in 15X8 grids.
The title of each grid indicates the sequence of the track in the original trackll.

# Generate trackll, and process, 
# e.g. mask region of interest, tracks from multiple files should not be merged.
