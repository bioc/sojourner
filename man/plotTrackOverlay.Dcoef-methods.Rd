\arguments{
\item{trackll}{trajectory list generated by createTrackll() and processing.}

\item{grid.size}{The size of each plot grid in nanometers. Default 1000 nm for x and y axis, respectively.}

\item{resolution}{ratio of pixel to ÂµM.}

\item{t.interval}{Time interval for image aquisition. Default 0.5 sec (500ms).}

\item{scale}{The pixel scale of image data.}

\item{dt}{Time inbervals.}

\item{filter}{Filter the tracks by step/frame number (length). Only tracks pass through filter will be selected.}

\item{rsquare}{R square filter on Dcoef results. Default to be 0.8. Set value to 0 if rsquare filter is not desired.}

\item{Dcoef.range}{Select tracks whose Dcoef is within the range. Other tracks will not be plotted.}

\item{color}{colors to interpolate to build the color gradient/ramp.}

\item{folder}{Path to provide nuclear glow backround. Images should end with "_Nuclei.tif". Default is NULL and not adding background.}

\item{file.No}{Select file(s) in the folder to plot. Default 0 for plotting all files in the folder.}

\item{line.width}{Line width for plotted tracks, default is 0.1.}

\item{trackll}{trajectory list generated by createTrackll() and processing. if NULL, user will be prompted to enter the trackll name.}

\item{resolution}{ratio of pixel to uM.}

\item{t.interval}{Time interval for image aquisition. Default 0.01 sec (10ms).}

\description{
Plot individual tracks one by one, with grid layout.
             Tracks are sorted by their lengths.

Plot track/trajectory overlays from a list of files in a folder with color coded 
             by the Diffusion Coefficient (Dcoef) of each track/trajectory.
}
\details{
Plot individual track/trajectory one by one, and the tracks will be layout in 15X8 grids.
             
         Upon running of the function, users will be prompted to input the name of the track list (trackll).
         Input un-merged trackll and the plotting will start. 
         The Dcoef is calculated by "static" method, which stabilizes the number of time lags used for fitting using time lag 2~ 5 despite the total time lags measured.

Plot track/trajectory overlays from a list of files in a folder with color coded 
         by the Diffusion Coefficient (Dcoef) of each track/trajectory. The range of Dcoef can be defined. Nuclei backgrounds can be added to the plots.
         Tracks from each file will be plot in one plot, i.e., one plot per file. Colors are flexible.
